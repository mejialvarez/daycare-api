# Daycare API

## Setup

This is a Rails 5 project that uses Mysql as the database. Once you have that installed, download the project by cloning it from Git:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:mejialvarez/daycare-api.git
```

Then, install the dependencies with:

```
$ bundle
```

Create the database and run the migrations by executing:

```
$ rails db:create
$ rails db:schema:load
```

You can seed the database running:

```
$ rails db:seed
```
